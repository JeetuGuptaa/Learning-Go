# Go Learning Journey

Welcome to my Go programming learning repository! This is where I document my progress as I learn the Go programming language.

## About This Repository

This repository contains various Go projects and examples that I'm building while learning. Each folder represents a different topic or concept in Go.

## Projects

### 1. [Hello World](1.%20helloworld/README.md)
My first Go program! This project covers:
- Basic Go program structure
- Understanding packages and imports
- The `fmt` package for output
- Essential Go commands (`go run`, `go build`, `go fmt`)
- File structure and organization

### 2. [Types and Variables](2.%20types-and-variables/README.md)
Learning about data types and variable declarations in Go:
- Basic types (string, int, float64, bool)
- Different ways to declare variables (`var`, `:=`)
- Type conversion and zero values
- Constants and multiple declarations
- Integer sizes and floating point types

### 3. [Functions and Return Types](3.%20functions-and-return-types/README.md)
Understanding how to create and use functions:
- Basic function syntax and parameters
- Return values (single and multiple)
- Named return values and naked returns
- Variadic functions (variable arguments)
- Anonymous functions and defer statements
- Recursion and functions as variables

### 4. [Arrays, Slices, and Loops](4.%20arrays-slices-loops/README.md)
Working with collections and iteration:
- Arrays (fixed-length) vs Slices (dynamic)
- Creating, appending, and slicing operations
- For loops (traditional, while-style, for-range)
- Break and continue statements
- Common patterns (sum, max, filter, etc.)

## Getting Started with Go

If you're new to Go, start with the Hello World project above. It provides a comprehensive introduction to:
- What packages are
- How imports work
- Basic Go syntax
- Running and building Go programs

## Useful Resources

- [Official Go Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/)
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
- [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/)

## Common Go Commands

```bash
# Run a Go program
go run filename.go

# Build an executable
go build filename.go

# Format code (Go's automatic formatter)
go fmt filename.go

# Check for common mistakes
go vet filename.go

# Clean build files
go clean
```

## Progress Tracker

- ✅ Hello World - Basic program structure
- ✅ Types and Variables - Data types and declarations
- ✅ Functions and Return Types - Function fundamentals
- ✅ Arrays, Slices, and Loops - Collections and iteration
- 🔄 More topics coming as I learn...
